# Why Outstream Video Ads Are Changing the Game

Not every publisher has video content — but almost every publisher wants video ad revenue.  
That’s exactly where **outstream video ads** come in.

They’re short, silent video ads that play between paragraphs, inside articles, or even in the corner of a page — and they’ve become one of the easiest ways for publishers to boost income without changing their content strategy.

## What Outstream Ads Actually Are

Traditional video ads (called _instream_) need a player — like YouTube or an embedded video on your site.  
Outstream ads don’t.

They load inside your existing layout — for example, between the second and third paragraph of a blog post — and play automatically when visible on screen.

When the user scrolls away, the ad pauses or closes automatically.  
No forced pop-ups. No noise. Just a short, smooth experience that doesn’t annoy readers.

<MyNote>Outstream = video ads for publishers who don’t publish videos.</MyNote>

## Why Advertisers Love Them

Video advertising is one of the most powerful branding tools.  
Advertisers want motion, sound, and visual impact — but they don’t always find enough premium video inventory.

Outstream solves that shortage.  
It lets brands reach more audiences through high-quality content sites, not just video platforms.

That’s why CPMs for outstream are usually **2x–3x higher** than standard display banners.

## Why Publishers Should Care

From a publisher’s point of view, outstream ads have several advantages:

- **High engagement:** Users notice them naturally while scrolling through content.
- **Better earnings:** Each ad delivers strong CPM and high view rates.
- **No redesign needed:** You can add them between paragraphs without breaking layout.
- **Better fill rates:** Many DSPs prioritize video campaigns because of brand budgets.

In short, they turn your text-based content into a hybrid format that earns like video media.

## How They Work Technically

When your page loads, the outstream tag checks the visible area.  
If the reader scrolls to a pre-defined position, the ad slot activates and requests a video creative from your demand partner.  
The ad plays automatically but stays muted by default to respect user experience.

Once the ad completes or goes out of view, it disappears or minimizes.

It’s simple, light, and completely programmatic.

## What Makes a Good Outstream Setup

The magic lies in placement and balance.  
Too many video ads can slow the page or overwhelm readers.  
Too few, and you miss the revenue potential.

For most blogs, placing one outstream ad:

- After the first or second paragraph
- Between long sections of text
- Or near the middle of the article

gives the best results without disrupting content flow.

You can also test floating video widgets that appear in a corner while the reader scrolls.  
These formats have strong completion rates and stay polite to the user.

## What to Avoid

A few mistakes can ruin the whole experience:

- Auto-playing with sound (always keep muted start)
- Heavy scripts from unknown providers
- Too frequent placements (one per 500–700 words is ideal)
- Ignoring CLS and performance scores

Stick to one reliable provider or wrapper integration that manages load balance and quality control.

## The PubThrive Perspective

Many publishers in PubThrive’s network saw a **30–50% revenue boost** after adding outstream video to their layouts — especially when paired with header bidding.  
It’s simple math: you’re letting video budgets compete for your same impressions.

And since outstream ads run within your existing layout, you don’t need to change your content strategy or add new sections. Just one smart placement does the work.

Outstream video isn’t the future — it’s the _now._  
If you’re running display-only, you’re leaving serious money on the table.  
The best part? You already have everything you need to start — just your content and a bit of space between your paragraphs.
