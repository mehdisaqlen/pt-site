# What Actually Happens Inside Google Ad Manager Auctions

Every time someone opens your website, an invisible race begins.  
Dozens of advertisers try to win a single ad slot — and it all happens in less than a second.

For most publishers, Google Ad Manager (GAM) runs this whole process quietly in the background.  
But if you want to understand your revenue deeply, it helps to know **what actually happens inside those auctions.**

Let’s take a look inside the machine.

---

## The Moment a Page Loads

When a user opens your page, the browser starts reading your HTML line by line.  
At some point, it reaches an ad tag — that’s when the auction starts.

That tag sends a **request to GAM’s ad server**, saying:

> “Hey, this user is on example.com, viewing an article, from this country, on this device. Who wants to bid?”

GAM then checks all possible demand sources connected to that ad slot:

- Your direct deals
- Header bidding partners
- Google Ad Exchange (AdX)
- Open Bidding partners
- Remnant networks or passbacks

All of them get a chance to respond, but only one will win.

  Each impression is a separate auction — millions happen every day, even on
  small sites.

## The Header Bidding Phase (If Enabled)

If you’re using header bidding, it kicks in **before** GAM’s main auction.  
Here, your wrapper (like Prebid.js) invites external demand partners to bid.

Each of them receives basic info about the impression — size, placement, device type, GEO — and returns a bid price, like $1.80 or $2.10 CPM.  
Once all bids are collected (within a timeout window), they’re passed into GAM as “key-value pairs.”

In other words, header bidding tells GAM:

> “Hey, here’s an advertiser outside Google willing to pay $2.10 CPM for this slot.”

Now the real fun begins.

## GAM’s Unified Auction

Once all bids (internal and external) are in, GAM starts its **unified auction.**

It compares everything together:

- Header bidding bids
- Google Ad Exchange bids
- Open Bidding partner bids
- Any direct-sold or programmatic guaranteed deals

The goal is simple — find the highest-paying, eligible ad that matches your rules.

---

## What Rules Are We Talking About?

Before the auction starts, you’ve already set conditions in GAM.  
These include:

- Line item priority (sponsorship, standard, network, price priority, etc.)
- Frequency caps
- Targeting (country, device, ad unit)
- Floor prices

These rules decide **who’s allowed to compete** and **who gets preference.**

Example:  
If you’ve sold a direct campaign for $3.00 CPM, it might automatically outrank a $2.80 open bid, even if the second one pays slightly less, depending on its priority type.

That’s how GAM keeps both your deals and open competition fair.

---

## Google AdX’s Role

Inside the unified auction, **AdX (Google Ad Exchange)** often behaves like just another bidder — but with deep access to Google’s huge advertiser base.

AdX collects bids from demand sources like Display & Video 360 (DV360), agencies, and brands using Google Ads.

Each bid comes with its own targeting signals:

- User interest category
- Device type
- Page context
- Historical performance

This data power is what makes AdX so competitive. Even when header bidders join, AdX often wins because it knows which ad will perform better.

---

## The Price You See Isn’t Always the Highest Bid

Here’s something most publishers don’t realize: the **winning price** isn’t always the top bid — it’s the **second-highest bid + $0.01** (or the minimum increment).

This is called a **second-price auction.**

Example:

- Bidder A offers $3.00 CPM
- Bidder B offers $2.60 CPM
- Bidder A wins but only pays $2.61 CPM

That’s how GAM keeps the system fair and efficient.

Some newer setups are shifting toward **first-price auctions**, where the winner pays exactly what they bid, but Google still blends logic depending on buyer type.

---

## How Latency and Viewability Affect the Auction

Even the best bids can lose if your ad loads too slowly or never becomes viewable.  
Advertisers track these metrics tightly.

If your ad slot’s **viewability rate** drops below 50%, future bids for that slot fall too.  
That’s why improving site speed and layout directly improves auction outcomes.

Faster pages mean more complete auctions, more competition, and better CPMs.

---

## Reporting and Data After the Auction

Once the winning ad serves, GAM records:

- The winning line item
- Bid price
- Advertiser or buyer type
- Impression and click data

This data flows into your reports within hours, allowing you to analyze trends — which placements earn more, which countries perform best, and which partners consistently win.

Over time, these patterns help you adjust your setup for better yield.

---

## Why Understanding This Matters

When you understand how the auction works, you stop guessing and start optimizing logically.

You know which levers matter most:

- Add strong header bidders
- Clean your layout to improve viewability
- Adjust priorities or floor prices
- Improve load speed for faster bid response

Each small improvement increases competition inside your GAM auction — and every bit of competition means more revenue.

---

Behind every ad you see on your site is a tiny, lightning-fast war of bids, rules, and algorithms — all fighting for that single impression.  
Knowing how it works doesn’t just make you smarter. It makes you a better publisher — one who earns more by understanding what most ignore.
